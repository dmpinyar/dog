Published built website on personal server using ngrok tunneling to circumvent port forwarding denial by router.
Uses apache server so that perl works correctly.

Go to my most recent branch for the most accurate report.
This directory represents where the permanent copies of the file are stored. The files ran by the server are 
stored elsewhere in the filetree, and that is why there is a python script to sync the changes (and generate a backup)

My commits on this repo will forever represent anything that is currently being forwarded by my own website.
I'll probably have different branches for whatever is currently being ran, so the practice branch may be reassigned.

But as it stands right now this serves as html, css, javascript, and perl practice work for developing a website.
In addition is serves to help me get some experience with public domain website creation and management utilizing
my own server (even if I don't have my own URL right now)

Because I am using the free version of this tunneling server it'll likely change on it's own, so I wouldn't
trust this link unless you can confirm with me that it's my port being tunneled, but URL is currently:
